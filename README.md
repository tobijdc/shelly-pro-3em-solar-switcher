# Shelly Pro 3EM Solar Switcher

Very work in progress.

Run on actual device!
(but no guarantee it fully works!)

TODO:

- [x] Refactor everything to be more state machine like
- [ ] Allow for time based override (i plan to use this for warm water, I want warm water also if there is no sunshine)
- [ ] Make the script more configurable

Possible extensions:

- [ ] Add Telegram Bot for alarms/daily summaries etc. :robot:
- [ ] Add Influxdb Cloud sync :cloud:
- [ ] Create Events when Relay is switched
- [ ] Make the script more configurable
- [ ] Actually emulate script with `espruino` for more confidence in testing

## Made with AI support

I have relied on AI a lot for this project.
